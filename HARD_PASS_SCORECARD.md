# MANAS360 Hard-Pass Scorecard

Date: 2026-03-01  
Scope: Mongo removal hard-pass, PostgreSQL-only validation, runtime readiness

## Final Verdict

**Status: GO (Hard-Pass Achieved)**

## 1) Dependency Purge — PASS

- Mongo stack removed from active backend dependency graph.
- Lockfile regenerated after cleanup.
- No active package references to `mongodb`, `mongoose`, or `mongodb-memory-server` remain in project code/docs scan scope.

## 2) Test Stack Cleanup — PASS

- Mongo-memory test helpers and legacy Mongo-bound integration suites were removed.
- PostgreSQL fixture-based test helper and integration validation tests are in place.
- Backend compile gates pass:
  - `npm run typecheck` ✅
  - `npm run build` ✅

## 3) Dist Purge/Rebuild — PASS

- Dist artifacts were purged and backend rebuilt successfully.
- Runtime import blocker in export controller was corrected and rebuild confirmed.

## 4) Full Project Scan (Zero Residual Terms) — PASS

- Full scan query used: `mongo|mongodb|mongoose|mongodb-memory-server|mongod`
- Result after final docs cleanup: **No matches found**.

## 5) DB Validation + Simulations — PASS

Validated against PostgreSQL (`manas360_dev`) with replay/idempotency/concurrency probes:

- Webhook replay protection:
  - First insert for same `eventId` succeeds.
  - Second insert fails with uniqueness violation ✅
- Payout approval concurrency (CAS-style update):
  - First transition `REQUESTED -> APPROVED` updates 1 row.
  - Second transition updates 0 rows ✅
- Subscription invoice idempotency:
  - First invoice insert succeeds.
  - Duplicate `razorpayPaymentId` insert fails ✅
- Cleanup of simulation rows completed after verification.

## 6) Runtime Validation — PASS (with advisory)

- Backend health endpoint verified on alternate port due local port conflict:
  - `http://localhost:5000/api/health` → `200 OK` ✅
- Frontend dev server + API proxy verified:
  - `http://localhost:5000/api/health` → `200 OK` ✅
- Advisory (non-blocking for hard-pass): local Redis is not running in this environment, causing background connection retries (`ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379`). Core API health remains green.

## Scoring

| Category | Result |
|---|---|
| Dependency Purge | PASS |
| Test Stack Cleanup | PASS |
| Dist Purge/Rebuild | PASS |
| Zero-Keyword Scan | PASS |
| Prisma/DB Validation | PASS |
| Replay/Concurrency/Idempotency Simulations | PASS |
| Runtime Health (API + Frontend Proxy) | PASS |

**Total: 7/7 PASS**

## Release Gate Decision

**GO** for PostgreSQL-only baseline and Mongo-removal hard-pass closure.

Optional next hardening step:
- Install/start local Redis to eliminate retry noise and fully validate queue/cache paths in dev runtime.
